Especially when it comes to knowing your customer and being able to reach them with relevant content, through the right channels, at the right time. To support this omni channel approach, businesses have increasingly been investing in Data and Marketing technologies. But all these different technologies only result in data siloes and fragmented customer data. To address this Tealium provides a vendor agnostic data hub that enables businesses to - collect customer data across all touchpoints and devices, both online and offline- correlate customer data into one single platform creating a complete customer view- activate this audience level data, in real time, to enhance and personalize your customer's experience- integrate this data into an existing data warehouse for extensive analytics capabilitiesOn a personal note:I am passionate about connecting with people and understanding their business and personal gains. Challenging them on why they choose to do things the way they do is something that drives me. When I am not working I love to spend time with my girlfriend and my two small boys, play poker and challenge myself in CrossFit.If you would like to learn more about me or about how Tealium can help you unlock the full potential of your customer data don't hesitate to contact me.✉️ danny.pentier@tealium.com✉️ danny.pentier@gmail.com (private)📱 +31 6 53 91 4881;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Tealium;Sales Director Benelux;feb-17;PRESENT;I am responsible for growing the footprint of Tealium in the Benelux market.Tealium powers the new era of real-time customer engagement and marketing, enabling global businesses to unlock their customer data and create more meaningful, relevant customer experiences.

This ‘trust but verify’ approach recognizes that the endpoint is the new perimeter of the organization;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Dtex Systems;Sales Director;nov-16;PRESENT;90% of data breach incidents are caused by users. As enterprises become more distributed and porous, it’s harder to control and get visibility into user activity.

This data is analyzed to alert you to malicious insiders, credential thieves, and employees who accidentally put your company at risk. Companies who use the Dtex platform find everything from incredibly advanced data theft to lateral movement and ransomware. Even companies who are protected by DLP programs, web filtering, and application whitelisting still find surprising and alarming results when they use Dtex to analyze actual user behavior.;;https://www.linkedin.com/company/113769;113769;;;Good Technology;Sales Director BeNeLux;aug-15;nov-16;Responsible for driving Good Technology sales and Business Development in the Benelux region.For most businesses, most of the time, security and mobility are conflicting values that can only advance at the expense of each other.

Volgens ons is dat geen nadeel, integendeel zelfs. Ons jonge bestaan vertaalt zich op de eerste plaats naar onze grote ambitie om onszelf te ontwikkelen. Ten tweede zijn onze (overhead) kosten zeer laag en hanteren we een transparante werkwijze. Flexibiliteit, persoonlijke aanpak en korte communicatielijnen zijn daarom karakteriserend voor YaWorks. Wij hanteren ook geen groeidoelstellingen die haaks staan op kwaliteit. Bij YaWorks vindt u dus geen medewerkers die slechts één bepaald kunstje kunnen, maar echte IT-professionals met hart voor de zaak. En wat ook belangrijk is, dat, hoewel het bedrijf jong is, de specialisten bij YaWorks zeer ervaren zijn. YaWorks is nu ruim 7 jaar op de ICT markt actief waarbij de focus ligt op het hogere marktsegment, zowel qua kennis en inzet hieromtrent maar ook de bedrijven waarbij YaWorks gevraagd word om haar kennis ter beschikking te stellen. YaWorks heeft zich in de afgelopen 7 jaar reeds bewezen in de markt en wordt inmiddels met de huidige omvang van ruim 100 medewerkers steeds meer gezien als een sterke kennispartner.

Nieuwe, contextueel slimmere oplossingen dragen bij aan het creëren van optimaal klantcontact. Contextueel slimme oplossingen maken op een handige manier gebruik van de al aanwezige data en applicaties. Waardoor uw medewerkers de focus kunnen leggen op de dialoog in plaats van de transactie of de zoektocht door alle verschillende systemen.Wat zou het voor u betekenen als klantcontactprocessen nauw aansluiten bij uw kwalitatieve en kwantitatieve organisatiedoelstellingen?  En wat zou het voor de medewerkers betekenen als niet alleen het proces geoptimaliseerd wordt; maar ook de schermen die aan de medewerkers worden getoond zijn aangepast aan hun specifieke wensen en de klantvraag. Brondata wordt daarbij steeds – willekeurig en relevant - ontsloten uit uw eigen bronsystemen. Indien gewenst kunnen uitkomsten van klantinteracties ook weer worden weggeschreven in de onderliggende systemen.De wijze waarop u als organisatie antwoord geeft op de klantvraag, bepaalt de uiteindelijke klantbeleving en -waardering.

De twee belangrijkste vragen daarbij zijn “waarom” en “hoe”. •	Waarom? Omdat veel organisaties baat hebben bij efficiënter en effectiever werken. •	Hoe? Zo simpel mogelijk!Ik geloof en heb laten zien (bewezen) dat veel organisaties kunnen verbeteren door zich hier continue mee bezig te houden. Intern heeft dit effect op efficiëntie, medewerkerstevredenheid en loyaliteit. Extern resulteert dit in een hogere klanttevredenheid en klantentrouw. Financieel geeft deze combinatie stabiliteit en een hoger rendement!Collegae en klanten kennen mij als kritisch en realistisch. Streven naar het hoogst haalbare, maar met oog voor praktische en vooral betaalbare toepasbaarheid. Met als resultaat een net even scherpere oplossing en hogere conversies van offerte naar opdracht. Ik ben trots als ik anderen heb geholpen op een hoger niveau te komen. Ik geniet in een omgeving waar iedereen met plezier en passie werkt. Ik bouw graag aan een omgeving en cultuur waar mensen vanuit hun betrokkenheid en passie samenwerken aan een hoge klanttevredenheid. Dit vormt de basis voor duurzame relaties en goede resultaten. Passioneel ben ik niet alleen zakelijk, maar ook als persoon. Het grootste deel van mijn leven houd ik mij al bezig met duursport. Altijd proberen te verbeteren en nooit opgeven.
