Mr. Kumar began buying apartment properties while still a student at the University of Regina in Canada. He grew his business by analyzing each property, buying under market value and improving the properties to increase resident occupancies. Throughout his acquisitions, Mr. Kumar has taken great pride in giving back to the community as he felt there should be a way in which a business could prosper even more by providing residents with a positive experience within their community. He was right; rebranding HK Capital to Ashford Communities and establishing community building as the company's business model resulted in 70% resident retention (double industry average). His strategy focuses on implementing programs, such as English classes or health camps, to promote a sense of brotherhood among residents, ultimately resulting in recurrent lease renewals despite rent increases. Ashford Communities has expanded its portfolio to 13 complexes reflecting a growth of 350% over the last four years and is one of the main sponsors of TotoAid, the organization founded alongside his wife, which provides education for children in Tanzania from elementary all the way thru college. Despite achieving rapid business success, Mr. Kumar did not allow it to impede him from expanding his knowledge further. He is currently focused on his academic growth and has enrolled inthe Harvard OPM Class of 2015 and EMP EO Class of 2017.

Judy Camarena seamlessly bridges the gap between tradition and transformation.

In less than a decade, Camarena has taken Arandas Franchises from a string of family-run franchises struggling to find a unified identity to a thriving, recognizable brand expanding into a growing number of markets with an increasingly diversified portfolio.

Before the age of 30, Camarena took her father’s dream – a traditional Mexican-style taqueria – and developed it into what now comprises nearly 30 Taquerias Arandas branch locations in Houston and Dallas, five Arandas Bakeries, two Ostioneria Arandas seafood restaurants and a Trailita Arandas mobile unit.

Under Camarena’s innovative leadership – which has spawned a full breakfast menu, new taco menus, full-service bars and specifically-tailored menu options – Taquerias Arandas is gaining a loyal and more diverse following as the company enters new communities, bringing approachable, authentic Mexican food to people who otherwise might not have tried it.

Camarena isn’t afraid to take chances and has helped Taquerias Arandas flourish in an economy where two-thirds of second-generation family businesses fail. Under her watch, Taquerias Arandas sales have increased 52 percent since 2003 and total franchise sales have increased to more than $60 million.

“I respect my family legacy, as well as the traditions and responsibilities that come with that,” Camarena said. “But I think it’s equally important to look to the future to make sure that we keep moving forward as a company.”

Camarena’s foresight and dynamic leadership have earned her multiple awards and accolades, including LATINA Style magazine’s Entrepreneur of the Year award for Houston and the 2006 Entrepreneurial Star Award for “Outstanding Accomplishments & Blazing the Trail on Behalf of Women & Minority Entrepreneurs.” She has also been a speaker at the University of Houston’s Friends of Women’s Studies “Table Talk.”",false,,"2018-01-28 22:50:05",,"Women, Restaurant, SBO, PRES, WOTC, Prospect, Houston",PRES,,www.linkedin.com/in/judycamarena,WOTC,,Female,,,,,,,,

You can genuinely have as many patient inquiries as you're able to handle coming into your practice every month - more if you want.So why haven't you heard about this before?For one it's because they don't teach advanced, ROI driven marketing in Medical School just like they didn't teach me to be a doctor in Marketing Classes.  Why would you have heard about it?By the way, they should teach Marketing in Med School, it's important to a practice don't you think?Secondly, I'm not shouting this out to the whole world so I can get ripped off by copycats and have the market flooded with cheap, ineffective copies.  Not in the plan.It's for the exclusive competitive advantage of my clients.  This is top shelf, first class.Send me a short message saying ""I'd like to know more"" and I'll send you some complimentary details.  No pressure, no obligation.  Just good usable info that will certainly get you more inquiries.  No Shenanigans! - No Tom Foolery! - And No Obligation :-)I'd love to talk results with you.  It's what I love to do!So if you offer Non Surgical Medical Services, such as Pain Management, Stem Cell Therapy, Knee Pain solutions, Back Pain solutions,  Stem Cell Neuropathy services, you owe it to yourself to reach out, it could well end up being a very productive message!

Most insurance agents that serve restaurants do not know the questions to ask regarding the specific industry risks restauranteurs assume.  This leaves the owner exposed to risks that they are not even aware they are taking that could significantly impact their business.Aegis also knows how to properly classify your general liability insurance so that you can have the peace of mind that your assets are properly covered and avoid unpleasant surprises down the road.Insurance costs restaurants less than 1% of their annual revenue.  We believe that restaurant executives should be more interested in ensuring their assets are properly protected versus being cheap on insurance that could cost them dearly in the future.To learn more about how we properly protect restaurants, either email me at adam@aegisifs.com or visit our website at http://www.aegisifs.com/restaurant-insurance.",false,,"2018-04-27 19:24:58",InsurTexas,,OWNER,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamsethmiller,COI,,Male,,,,,,,,id:3Sm9-1LtWxwAAAAAAAA8PA
