Beldon Roofing Company,5039 West Ave, San Antonio, TX 78213, USA,+1 210-341-3100,http://www.beldon.com/,https://maps.google.com/?cid=17341715109159731967,4.2,roofing_contractor, point_of_interest, establishment,Although we are very pleased with the workmanship and quality of our new gutters we can only give 3 stars.  We would love to give 5+ stars to Cesar, Raul, and Marco who installed them.  They were professional, knowledgeable, friendly, and extremely courteous.  Cesar and his crew did a great job with the installation with attention to detail and function. The low rating is due to the poor communication we received from the corporate and San Antonio offices.  Calls not returned and zero resolution with issues thru their offices.,I had to wait several months to get a replacement roof due to hail damage from  Beldon because they were so busy.  But, it was worth it in spades.  They were top notch in every respect.  They did a great job of negotiating  with my insurance company to get the top quality shingles that  I had replaced.  The  project manager was  seriously involved and the  expert team  did a great job of installation and clean up .  The follow  up inspection was real and  they actually did a couple of extra  jobs  not  in the contract.  The way this company operates  is very impressive and  I strongly recommend them if you value your house.,I want to give the highest possible review to my Beldon Project Consultant, Jane Gimbel. She helped me select the exact gutters that would be best for me; she adjusted the water flow to make it simpler and more reliable; and she helped me resolve any problems. I would not hesitate to work with her again.,Beldon Roofing was amazing to work with. The office staff was so nice and kept me informed during the whole process. Thanks to the whole team, love my new roof!,I worked with TEAM BELDON. I have not found a more sincere company to work for across of sectors of my career. The leadership is above reproach when it comes to truly striving for customer service. The care they show towards their staff in my opinion is second to none. They might make some mistakes but the will to correct them earns my respect.
Cloud Roofing Company,434 Breesport St, San Antonio, TX 78216, USA,+1 210-366-9484,http://www.cloudroofing.com/,https://maps.google.com/?cid=11246407719875729328,2.9,roofing_contractor, point_of_interest, establishment, recently had a roof repair done prior to hurricane Harvey by this company. I had a leak around the chimney which had leaked inside on the ceiling.There representative inspected the area to be repaired and gave me an estimate of $850.00, and an estimated schedule for the repair, which as approximately in two weeks. With the hurricane approaching I was concerned that I would incur more damage inside so I call the representative and he came out and put a tarp around the suspect leaking area. This temporary solution held up during the storm and I did not have any more leaking inside. About two weeks later a roofing repair crew came out to do the repair which took about an hour. A week later I received an invoice for $850.00, which was the same as the estimate. I spoke to the representative toexpress my concern that the cost of the repair was very high for the materials and the the time spent to do the job.The representative offered to reduce the cost buy $100.00 but I feel $750.00 is still very expensive for the repair. I asked for an invoice refelecting the adjustment and a detailed list of the repair. Waiting to see if this happens.,Terrible company. The shingles they used for the roof repair they did for me did not even match my roof-they are a totally different color! When I called to ask for someone to come by and look at it, they said they were too busy for at least a month, and nobody ever showed up or called. Today my roof is leaking again, and sagging where they did the (very over priced) repair. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY.,Had issues with the quality of work done by the Cloud Roofing crew hired to install roof.  The owner, Ken Cloud, did contact me and visited my home but all he did was make excuses and yell at me.  He said that customer satisfaction is not his responsibility.  You would be wise to go with another company as his integrity and basic customer service skills are lacking.  Due to my customer experience, one star is one too many.,My roofing experience w/ Cloud Roofing was the WORST I've ever encountered with any roofing company I've have ever used in the past. The final product of my roof replacement left for a WAVY ROOF throughout. They never spoke to me about re-decking options and/or replacing rotten wood. When I called to remedy the situation...Cloud roofing (Aaron & Mr. Ken Cloud) gave me a run around that lasted 5 months. In the end, they wouldn't do anything to repair or redo the job. They blamed the quality of the poor job on simply being bombarded due to the storm, and they simply couldn't keep up with the influx of jobs. In addition, the owner went on to say that, "well, all houses in Leon Valley have wavy roofs...it's not a big deal". My experience was one of a RUSHED JOB with POOR workmanship, broken communication, lack of customer options, neglected upfront quality control, and very low standards in the overall job that they provided. I would definitely NEVER DO BUSINESS with Cloud Roofing again, and I encourage you not to unless you want to be taken advantage of by being given a SLOP roof job. Spare yourself the agony! This company should be ashamed of themselves.,This is for the man driving in the brown colored Escalade. Maybe next time you won't be cutting people off while trying to hurry up and switch lanes to get off the high way. P.S. you may not want to be advertising your business while driving like an idiot.

The did an amazing job for me and never had any issues. Professional, awesome job! Defiantly recommended to my family and friends.,They do not stand behind what they do.  10 year warranty that is a joke.  Big mistake picking them to replace my roof.  Do yourself a favor and never use Tony's Roofing.,They took my insurance check back in June.. An over $6000 check.. It's almost 6 months now since the original estimate, and 4 months since they took the check and still we have no roof on.. Seems I was scammed I am contacting my insurance to get a new check and to have Tony's held accountable for taking the money without doing any work,He gave a good estimate, but did not show up to actually do the work.  We had a small job, and Tony wanted to make it a bigger job, and quoted what seemed like a low price for what he wanted to do.  When I hesitated, he quoted an excellent price for the small job we really needed done.  After talking it over with my wife, I got back to him the next day and told him we'd go small, but that he could charge extra for his time when picking up the materials he'd need.  He agreed and told us he'd most likely be over later that day.  Otherwise he would be over the next day.  Well, the long and short of it is he did not show up either day, did not call, and did not return our calls.  Good prices, nothing done - not a good deal.,Tony's roofing was fast, honest, and reliable. Did the job right and in one day. I would recommend him to anyone.Oh yeah, love the upgrades, and house is cooler.

My next door neighbors had their roof redone by Decker Roofing.  I was extremely impressed with the company's professionalism and respect for property owners.  They began their work at a reasonable 7 am, not making any loud noises until 8 or 9am.  While pulling off the old roof, some of the material fell into my yard, no fault of Decker's and they asked (respectfully and in English) before entering my property and cleaned very thoroughly.  After they we're done, I noticed a small pile of nails left on my garage steps.  Initially I was pissed, how could they have missed so many?!  I was wrong, they had neatly piled up nails from the grass I had dropped 6 years ago when replacing the fence, carefully sorting all their roofing nails out.  The yard had already been magnetically swept twice!  I can't comment on pricing but their work looks good and they are as professional and respectful as I've seen in any contracting company.

Easily 5 stars.,We just had our roof beautifully done by Alonso - Tiger and his Santex Crew.  They were proficient, professional & very reasonably priced.

Couldn't ask for more.,Receptionist would not give me a name so i would know who i was speaking to. Very Poor attitude and it would not be a good way to start a business relationship.

I recently had a stain pop up on my ceiling. My neighbor referred me to Stephen's. When my rep came out she advised I should call my insurance company and have an adjuster come.

Within a few days I had a brand new roof and no headaches!

We did and two months later it was totaled in a hailstorm. Our insurance company gave us a short list and we called two. The first wanted to do the re-roofing but also wanted to scam the insurance and wanted us to go along. The second to assess the roof was Yuras Roofing. They were straightforward, honest and extremely professional. So much attention was paid not only to our new landscape but also to our pets to make sure no nails or debris were left and no plants were damaged. We replaced the roof after another storm many years later and it was another professional expert experience. Twenty-five years later from the first roof and a new house and another new roof.  Beautifully done and again no worries with the company and with owners Joe and Robert. What I haven't mentioned is in all that time we have never had a leak or problem with a Yuras installed roof. So after three roofs and several referrals to friends I can say they are quite simply the very best to trust with your most prized possession. HIGHLY recommend!!!,Great company.  They've repaired my roof on more than one occasion. ,One of the oldest roofing companies around since 1948. Family operated and a family member estimates and inspects each job. The only negative is they only have so many crews. The wait is worth it. Recommended by EVERY insurance adjustor around. 5 year labor warranty and they handle manufacturer warranty claims. The best work at fair prices.,Yuras Roofing completed our roof last week, and we are very pleased with the work done.  We received a thorough, line-by-line quote.  Joe Yuras coordinated the date of the work with us, and his crew arrived promptly, worked diligently, and did a good job.  Highly recommend!!!!

First time having to have a roof replaced and this first class organization and its people made it seamless. Brandon and Will were both easy to get a hold of and were professional, upfront, and over all a pleasure to work with. Their roofing crew was efficient and thorough too. If you're in the San Antonio, Houston, or Coastal Bend area and need roofing work, look no further. Great Built is the company you want to use!,Professionals from the very detailed estimate through to the job completion. The work crew arrived as scheduled, removed the old shingles and installed the new roof, all in one day. They also did a good job of cleaning up. I am very pleased with the work.,Great Built Roofing delivered on their promises, and then some.  They provided exceptional service, quality work, and not only met, but exceeded, our expectations.  We highly recommend giving them a call to assess your roofing needs.,Best roofer I have ever meet. Replaced my roof in 2017. I have recommended him to all my friend and family.,This is a "Great" company with values, and attention to doing a job the right way.  Back when we had the hail storm I waited to get estimates.  Most places I called wanted to know if this was an insurance claim right off the bat.  If you told them you wanted an impartial estimate they would hang up.  Not Great Built.  They never asked.    Gary came out and gave me an estimate, and the owner, Neely, came out after the job was done to make sure everything was good to go.   A week or so later Gary came by to check on things.  I found a nail that wasn't all the way  down.  He promptly fixed it.      If that review isn't good enough.....     I was so impressed by this company when my mother-in-law said insurance would no longer insure her roof we called Great Built.   The estimator spent about 2 hours on the estimate, but when asked if the roof needed replacement he told us it didn't.    It would have been easy for him to say it did, and charge us $9K.  I asked him why he didn't.....  His answer was awesome.   "This company doesn't operate that way, and if they did I wouldn't work for them".

They are the best!!  Their customer service and follow-up is top notch!!  Abel is fantastic!!  He will take his time in explaining the product to ensure that you get the perfect roof!  We upgraded our shingles and added additional vents.  Michelle and Aaron in the billing department are amazing.  They worked with our insurance company and invoiced them for the final payment, leaving us out of it completely.  Finally, the crew!!!  From start to finish, they were efficient and did an AMAZING job on our roof.  Additionally, they were meticulous about ensuring our front and back yard were SPOTLESS!!  We might not have the nicest house in our neighborhood, but we DEFINITELY have the nicest roof!!  Thank you Integrity Roofing & Siding!!,Had my roof replaced after last year's hail storm. I chose integrity because they had done the roof to an addition on my home and it looked like it was done well. It took them about 6 months before they could actually replace the roof. This wasn't a problem because by old one was still holding up. The staff have been polite and professional however, very difficult to get a hold of. Now my issue. First storm of the year, my roof leaks. I had wet drywall and parts of my ceiling falling apart. I had to leave messages and call over and over for most of the day before anyone answered at the office. A tech came out the next day,put some caulking around the skylight that was leaking ( something that they forgot to do when they put the new roof on) gave me his number in case it leaks again and said that they would recheck it in a year. No offer to fix the damage caused by their negligence. A few weeks later, my roof is leaking again. Same spot as last time, with even more damage. I've now called the tech and office, left a message but it's a weekend. I have no ladder to get on my roof and cover the leak and there's more rain on the way. Thank you integrity roofing. My children and I are now just preying that the roof will hold through these storms.,Every worker displayed talent, and untiring effort in a hot and high work environment. Roofing is artisan beauty and my roof is a completed project reflecting excellence!,Spoke with an agent yesterday, and after several questions from the representative had an appointment scheduled. Just received a call from the estimator stating that they do not do residential properties in my area. This being after I made it very clear the first go around where the property was, and also letting them know it was residential. A few minutes later got a call back saying that the person who originally scheduled me was in training. Thanks for the apology, but it still doesn't get my roof fixed. On the plus side, if they can't even train someone answering their phones about what services they provide or even which areas they service, maybe it's for the best.,Due to the recent hailstorm in San Antonio, we had to have our roof replaced.  I contacted several roofing companies, and many companies were "fly by night operations." After careful review, we selected Integrity Roofing to complete the job.  The sales rep, Abel, went over the roof replacement process.  He told us what we should expect and who would be contacting us throughout the process.  True to their word, we received calls along the way explaining what the next steps would be to complete the job.  I always knew what to expect...The roof looks beautiful, and they completed it in a timely manner.  Thank you, Integrity Roofing, for a job well done!
Rio Blanco Roofing & Restoration,600 Sandau Rd #800, San Antonio, TX 78216, USA,+1 210-253-9665,http://rioblancoroofing.com/,https://maps.google.com/?cid=7251330554232497698,5,roofing_contractor, general_contractor, point_of_interest, establishment, wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude towards your company. In the beginning of this process I researched for roofing companies which led me to Rio Blanco Roofing & Restoration. From the start Jim’s customer service was outstanding and he was very helpful throughout the whole process of getting my roof replaced. I couldn’t be happier with the quality and appearance of my new roof. And there are still companies out there worth taking a moment out of your day to praise the hard work and dedication to their product and expertise.   Proud home owner,Joe G.,Jim and his crew did a wonderful job on my roof. They were on time and did quality work. The price was great and they left my house and yard clean. They went way above what they were supposed to do and did an exalant job. I would recommend them to all my family and friends. You get 5 stars from this family. Thank you so much for a great job done on time.,Rio Blanco is the best!!!  I had a leak and they came the same day.  Jim was really knowledgeable about my insurance and even gave me two different estimates!  One for shingles, and one for a mental roof..  they got everything done in a timely manner and cleaned everything up around my house everyday!!!  Thank you Rio Blanco!!,Great company! Jim was great to work with and the roofing crew did an excellent job!  Highly recommend!,I previously left a review where I was unhappy with the communication from Rio Blanco. That was due, unfortunately, to an employee who is no longer with the company and not the fault of Jim and his team. Since then, I have worked with Jim and his team and I am extremely happy with their work. They came out and repaired some flashing and siding issues around my chimney, and I am very satisfied with the communication and repairs. Jim worked hard to make everything right and I could not ask for more. I will highly recommend Rio Blanco to anyone who needs roofing work done.

Alexander's is a great roofing company. The staff is very professional.   Someone was out to my house quickly to inspect my roof and give me a quote.  Once the contract was signed the materials were ordered and the roof was replaced.  The workers were professional and cleaned up all materials after the work was finished.  The owner came back two days  later to collect payment and he even pointed out differences between my roof and some of my neighbors who recently had their roofs replaced by other companies.   I am very pleased with Alexander's roofing and would highly recommend if you need a roof replacement.,Yes, this man arrived at my residence and let me tell you he was so nice and very intelligent and blunt. My roof was needing a change he tells me the problems that my roof needed,the workers were so professional and they completed the job with no problem. Thanks Alexander😃,Very profesional and cutious workers and staff. They started and completed my roof on schedule and did an outstanding job.  They completed my roof without any money down until my insurance submitted payment weeks later. During that time I was never bothered.  I highly recommend this company.,Two missed appointments. No callback.  Sad.,This roofing company has completed  several roofing projects for me through  the years they are an honest, company and they stand behind their work. I would highly recommend them to anyone

This guy is going to die of old age in prison, he will never breathe free air again- chickens finally came home to roost!!  Mark was already on lifetime parole, he got sentenced to prison for the rest of his natural life, zero eligibility for any parole whatsoever...,DO NOT SIGN A CONTRACT WITH DANIEL GARCIA this guy doesn't work for this company anymore. I swear to you San Antonio it'll be like giving your soul to the devil. I had no idea he didn't work for this company anymore and wrote them a check and have been waiting to hear back for over a month. When he finally returns my phone call he threatens me and calls me "impatient" because I can't wait. Waiting to hear back from Durizon to see what they will do about this mess! But I was told that Durizon is looking for all of his clients and will be giving it to someone else. San Antonio BEWARE!!,Do not do business with Durizon Roofing & Construction Company.  Do not give this company a penny.  They are thieves and will keep your money and give you false promises of starting the work but they never even return your phone call.  Don't get scammed.  This company is now under criminal review.,All the 5 star comments here are obviously fakes produced by Durizon. A good friend of mine gave Durizon a $12,000 down payment check for his roof to get redone with the top of line asphalt shingles from Owens Corning. Durizon cashed that check 10 months ago and has still not done the roof. Last month or so they delivered shingles, but they were the cheapest low end "dimensional" that owens corning sells. There's no other way to describe that than an overt attempt to rob my friend. My friend caught it and they took the materials back, claiming the others would have to be ordered and would be 2 weeks. They've been saying "two weeks" about everything since October of 2015 when he signed the contract. I have no proof that they are frauds, but they are definitely fools. Don't go with any "roofing company" who's main goal seems to be to get a look at your insurance "paperwork". Demand  that they give you an estimate on your roof. If they look dumbfounded or irritated, tell them to GTFO. Trust me, they aren't "roofers",DO not sign with these guys Mark Rodriguez and Richard steven.They got my 5542.67 down payment and never look back.Please call Officer Ronald Davis at 207-8326 if they took your money

Bondoc Roofing,900 Isom Rd Ste. 222, San Antonio, TX 78216, USA,+1 210-896-3209,http://www.bondocroofing.com/,https://maps.google.com/?cid=12445536418542714872,4.8,roofing_contractor, point_of_interest, establishment, strongly recommend Bondoc Roofing. You meet and describe your problem with the owner James Bondoc. James is very knowledgeable and can offer the most competitive solution using top quality materials and craftsmen. His installers were a desirable team of skilled metal technicians who met my high quality standards. James also monitors the entire project and conducts a final walk through inspection with you for your approval.,Recommended - good, reliable roofing company. We had some shingles missing from a storm and a friend recommended them. They did the repairs for a reasonable price and we would definitely use them again.,After a hail storm and major wind damage, our roof was in such disarray and we were in distress. My husband and I delayed our repairs because we simply could not get comfortable with the approach other roofing companies had for overseeing a roofreplacement from start to finish. With James (owner of Bondoc Roofing), we were just so impressed with his professionalism, communication throughout, his crew's timeliness and definitely Bondoc's quality of work. The follow through every single step of theprocess to include closing the loop with us post-replacement to ensure we were fully satisfied did not go unnoticed. Additionally, one of the crew called after the job to come by to do a final, final inspection to ensure everything was perfectly tidy - there was not a single remnant of construction and they were mindful to cover things like our pond during the tear down and replacement. Bondoc Roofing also went the extra mile and included some incidental gutter work and repairs at no charge. It is very apparent that quality and customer satisfaction is their #1 priority. We could not be more pleased with the crew and office staff at Bondoc. We'd definitely give them 10 stars if we could!,We live out-of-state and had to have roof repair done on our rental property in San Antonio because of a leak that developed during some bad weather. The Bondoc Roofing representatives we spoke with (Eliza, James, & Bryant) were polite/friendly, answered our questions, patiently explained the problem and their recommended solution, and emailed us photos before and after the repair. We did have to wait some time to get on the repair schedule because the company was very busy, but on one of our follow-up calls to try to get on the schedule, we found-out they had already performed the repair, and they quickly apologized for not contacting us and keeping us informed. Overall, we have had a positive experience with Bondoc Roofing.,Bondoc Roofing is top-notch!  My roof recently sustained some damage from a storm earlier this spring and after several inquiries, I chose Bondoc Roofing after a solid recommendation.  They are experts in their field and without question did a tremendous job.  I was also faced with selling my home after the storm and Bondoc Roofing went out of their way to meet my deadlines and personal needs to make my sell successful.  Most importantly, Bondoc Roofing is excellent with customer service.  Alexis is the real deal and all businesses should model her style in providing superior courtesy and respect to clients.  I highly recommend Bondoc Roofing!
CJ's Roofing,114 N Ellison Dr #110, San Antonio, TX 78251, USA,+1 210-201-3687,http://www.cjsroofingllc.com/,https://maps.google.com/?cid=9819010744812915779,4.5,roofing_contractor, point_of_interest, establishment,CJ's roofing came out and gave me an estimate within a day. They were very affordable. Carlos and Ruby were friendly and professional. They answered all my questions. The next week they started my roof. The roofers were on schedule every morning. It took two days to complete. I appreciate that they cleaned up well afterwards. I would recommend them.,I am very pleased w the work that CJ’s men did. I got a whole new roof for my apartment and Carlos adjusted the price when he saw the decking didn’t need replacing. Most companies would not have done that.This is the second time that I have used CJ’s. They corrected a mistake that another company had made. This was another house.Again I am VERY pleased!,The work was started and finished very quickly. The roof looks great and the high end materials will add value to the house. Thank you Carlos and crew!,Terrible roofers. We had a leak on our new roof within a month after they "repaired" it because they forgot to seal around external fixtures on the roof. They also outsourced partial work for the project to a contractor whose quality of work was very poor and still does not appear completed (a separate roofer solicited our house about 1 year after the initial repair and told us our roof looked damaged and asked us if we wanted him to fix it).Now the company is sending us veiled threats regarding possible legal action to cover their poor performance. Avoid this company, there are plenty of better ones to choose from.,We contracted with CJ's Roofing for repairs in Rockport after Hurricane Harvey.  We asked CJ's to bid because of the high rating it has on Angie's List based on 200 reviews.  CJ's removed the damaged roof and installed a new one in less than three days and also replaced damaged siding and repaired damaged porches, all at a competitive price.  The roof was a challenge because it is very steep.  The crew worked well together, were very professional and polite.  Each day they cleaned the work site of debris.  We were very pleased with the work that CJ's did especially considering the fact that it was done to repair our storm damaged house in such a timely manner.
Titan Roofing, LLC,21750 Hardy Oak Blvd Suite 102, San Antonio, TX 78258, USA,+1 210-338-8141,http://www.gotitanroofs.com/,https://maps.google.com/?cid=2381582716444999038,5,roofing_contractor, general_contractor, point_of_interest, establishment,itan roofing did a great job with our home. Chris, Adam and thier crew were awesome to work with! Thank you!!!,We live 1400 miles away from San Antonio, but bought a house in Boerne. We realized that we might encounter some drawbacks buying a home so far away, and not being familiar with the people and services provided in the area. The home was 18 years old and the inspectors said the roof was still good, but due to the age it did have some issues. .So it was our decision to have the roof replaced rather than wait until problems might occur.Using the Internet we obtained a number of proposals and used the BBI and vendor website reviews (5 Star) to help evaluate the area roofers.  One of the top companies that kept coming up was Titan Roofing whose owner Christopher Fentress who personally contacted us.  To make a long story short Christopher followed through with  everything and was very helpful throughout the whole process. His communications was impeccable. His people were on time, the job completed as promised and the project was cleaned up spottlessly.  We are pleased to write a positive review and have absolutely no complaints.,Now, I know why Titan has great reviews.  Chris and his crew are awesome.  When I first contacted the company, Chris immediately came out and looked at the roof.  He answered all my questions.  Best part, all the other companies insisted on knowing how much my insurance was giving for the claim, not Chris.  He gave me a quote which included more than we even expected.  To me, that showed he was fair and not trying to take advantage of my insurance company.  Chris is a genuine businessman with integrity. .  His crew is some of the hardest working individuals I have ever seen.  They were respectful and polite.  Our roof looks great and we are very happy with it.  In fact, people keep driving by and looking at what a great job they did.  Chris, also, was out ensuring everything was done correctly.  However, with his crew, they were superb even in the horrible heat we had in July.  We had to have some plywood replaced and Chris is even coming back on a Sunday to paint it.  ***Update:  Chris did come back and paint.  He is definitely a man of his word!Thank you Chris and the wonderful crew.  If we ever need roofing again, we are surely going to call Titan.,I had several companies come out and give me estimates for my roof from hail damage. Several companies tried explaining and justifying the cost of the roof by stating they used a better quality of material. Titan Roofing used material that matched or surpassed the quality of material other companies were going to use. And the cost of the roof with Chris' company, Titan was substantially cheaper than others had quoted. They came out and started working on my roof on the day they stated they would start. Chris stated the crew would start around 0800.  My doorbell rang at 0805.  I was surprised they were on time. Other contractors that have done work for me have always been running behind schedule.  I called Chris about a concern I had during the first day.  My concern was addressed promptly and I was reassured the finish product would be exactly what I expected and more. Chris was always a pleasurable and professional person to work with. After my roof was done, I must admit I was very pleased with the way it came out.  The attention to the small details on the roof really set my house apart from the ones around us.  The high definition roof added so much to curb appeal. I highly recommend Titan Roofing to anyone looking for a reputable company.,Chris and Titan Roofing  did a great job and exceeded our expectations. Our roof was damaged by last year's storms and Chris was quick to respond and to get the ball rolling. He dealt with the insurance claim without a snag or complaint and our roof was done perfectly. We couldn't be happier with the results and the overall experience.

Estimate was fast and fairly priced. No scheduling issues. Pics were great for our records.  Highly recommend. ,Thank you very much for a great work on my roof. Yall are life savers.! Will recommend to everyone.,They replaced a functional roof with a brand new roof, but they didn't seal it properly around the flashing and created a leak. They repaired their mistake but didn't repair the damage to the inside, now I'm left with a bill for the roof and a bill for repairs for inside, and Stevens is threatening me with a lien while repairs are still being done due to their mistake.On top of all the recent stuff, Stevens took over 6 months from contract signing to deliver the roofing and to start work, but that was a bit expected. However, it wasn't expected that they would deliver the roofing material to the roof without notice, just one day you come home with a metric ton of trash on the roof and no notice. A waste of a company, go with someone else if you have a chance.,I've worked with this company and  seen the work that they have done its very good and I can recomend you working with them.
Priced Right Roofing Co,507 S General McMullen Dr, San Antonio, TX 78237, USA,+1 210-767-3513,http://www.sanantoniotxroofing.com/,https://maps.google.com/?cid=5190246895576447485,1,roofing_contractor, point_of_interest, establishment,here are always two sides to a story, and of course, pros and cons to each company. I've heard that this company does well when it comes to getting their job done. However, as important performance is, it is as important to me that a company has a good professionalism. Long story short, when I started pressing Ray (the owner of Priced Right Roofing) about lying to me, he wanted to "throw down" and explained to me he doesn't know how it is like where I came from, but in Texas, they do it differently.To explain further, while they were working on the roof, I was affected by having my AC turned off. Understanding that it is not their fault that the AC got turned off, I wanted to know what happened that made me suffer through a night in a 90 degree room. When I first brought up the issue to the owner (Ray) of Priced Right Roofing, he instantly replied by stating that it is not their fault. Explaining to him that it would have made sense that before leaving at the end of the day, that they check that all the ACs are connected (since the ACs could get disconnected as they moved the wires around to continue their work). Many times throughout the conversation, his story kept changing. He said that all the ACs are connected, and that they should run fine. Then, he said that a switch might have been turned off. Thinking that he was referring to a breaker, i told him that I had it turned off and back on and still doesn't work. Then, he said that the switch is inside the building, where the building management would know where it is (and I spoke to the maintenance people, and found out that the "switch" doesn't exist). Frustrated about this lies, I had to go on the roof myself to see what was going on. That's when I found out that one of the ACs was broken. When i asked Ray's employee, i was told that the AC broke yesterday, and he let Ray know. Once I started confronting Ray about this, he started to change the subject and said that he would "throw down". There are many things that went wrong here. But, what I really hope to achieve is that others don't go through this awful experience. I am glad that I found out that the AC was broken from the employee. If not, who knows Ray would have dumped the expense of fixing the AC to my building management.

Chris listened to my concerns and ideas I had in remodel my home and was very helpful in providing guidance.  He worked with me during the construction process and even allowed me some time to extract insulation from my attic during the re-decking of my roof with Tech Shield Radiant Barrier (I highly recommend this product...big difference in attic and home temperatures).  His roofing crew was very professional and had tons of experience.

I highly recommend Kidd Roofing.,Jeremy was professional and called ahead to let me know when he would be arriving. Addressed my concerns and said to call if there were any other problems. Very straightforward fellow which is appreciated.,Eric Roesler with Kidd roofing was an amazing contractor to work with.  I was in the process of selling my  home and moving out of state. I needed to have my roof removed and replaced.  Also needed new gutters removed and installed.Eric dealt with my insurance company and managed the entire roofing project seamlessly. He's probably the best sub-contractor I've ever worked with... professional, reliable, and honest! Thanks for all the help Eric.,Horrible! They don't call back. I have been waiting for two months and today I'm told they have some problems and cant get to it. I even gave them a referral and they never even called them. Sorry! Sorry! Company and representative!

The guy disappeared and I called the main office and they sent Mr. Wallace. He was helpful and got the job done on time. The roof looks good but during installation the crew pushed the lid of the furnace exit shut and fumes were accumulating in the attic. Invision refunded the expense of getting it fix, which is why I am now giving a good review. If you hire them, ensure the project manager gets on the roof and examines the job, the issue could have been prevented by a final inspection. Overall the service was good and the roof looks great and they took care of the only issue I had with the installation. I will call them again if needed, and I will ask for Mr. Wallace again.Thanks for your help Mr. Wallace.,This is exactly what a roofing experience should be like. Prompt service and quick, easy communication.  Great work and better than fair price.,Great job.., everything was fixed correctly and on time, within budget, after hurricane Harvey made a mess here in Corpus Christi. I would recommend this company to all my friends and family.,I would not recommend or refer Invision to anyone I liked or know. Several RED FLAGS were immediately waving when the 13 to 15 year old Invision Roof Representative showed up. The kid looked at the roof for approximately 20-30 seconds, then wanted to know about insurance, I told him I was paying cash, insurance was not involved. He told me he would give me a quote in two hours. I have been eagerly waiting to see a quote for a job by someone who took no measurements or specifications. I was quickly told by a  representative for consumer protection that it is very difficult to maximize price inflating during large natural disaster for Roofing companies such as Invision when they are told it is cash not insurance. These folks are obviously on the prowl looking for windfall opportunities.....becareful roofing companies like Invision are a dime a dozen right now.,Matt at Invision Roofing is wonderful. He is honest and will take care of a whole new roof (if needed) as well as the smaller jobs. He is very prompt at giving a bid and at scheduling and completing each job. I'm a realtor and he is my go-to roofer as he always come through when we need him - with a quality job and a great price. Call him and you won't be disappointed!

Such a pleasant transaction from start to finish. The customer service provided was phenomenal. They explained in great detail about the process regarding insurance and the roofing company. As a first time homebuyer, it was well appreciated as I am not sure how that works. Jared, who I was working with from NRC, kept me well informed about the process and was very responsive throughout the entire time. The roofing company came out and finished most of it in ONE day. Additionally, the offered to replace some rotting wood I had going on that I had no idea I had! They worked very quick and efficient. Last but not least, the price. I contacted a couple of roofing companies initially-and Norwest Roofing Company was by far the best bid. I absolutely recommend this company to anyone who needs work done. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,I recently had Norwest Roofing Company replace a standing seam roof at my business. The roof was old and suffered hail damage in the April storms. I was very pleased with the customer service this company provided. From the first phone call to the completion of the job everything went well and as planned. The crew was asked to start on a Friday due to the office being closed.  They were there early and worked through the day to get the old roof removed and all old materials were hauled away at the end of the day. When they started the replacement the following Monday, they were very mindful of the fact that our parking lot would have several cars and people coming and going for their appointments. They were never in the way and made sure that areas to avoid were properly marked with caution tape.  The end of each day everything was picked up and left clean. When the job was completed they even trimmed up some trees in the parking lot at no extra charge. The roof looks amazing and I couldn’t ask for anything better. Thank you Norwest Roofing.,After having a few quotes on roof work needing to be done, Norwest Roofing had the best pricing and their reviews were neck and neck with the other 3 companies I was considering. Jared was great to work with and easy to get ahold of. He kept me up to date on what was happening the day of the repairs. Norwest was able to come out for the repairs within a week.,Needed roof fixed before selling house.  Norwest came out to assess and gave estimate within 24 hours.  Price was competitive and roofers were pleasant, professional, and knowledgeable.  Overall, a very good experience! Would definitely use them again if needed.  Highly recommend!,Update! Jacob, a co-owner, contacted me and just came out to clean everything up. He was kind, responsive, accommodating, and apologetic. He and another gentleman did a very thorough cleaning. Norwest has also revamped how they approach their jobsites and will now leave flyers on neighbors' doors to stay ahead of these kinds of situations.  I think this was just an honest mistake and a fluke. I was very pleased with their response, and my neighbors seem happy with their new roofing. I'm impressed with how they handled this situation and are now being proactive. They very generously offered me an HEB gift card for the inconvenience. In short, I appreciated their sincerity and willingness to make things right. OP: I'm not a customer, but my neighbor is. They had their roof done a few weeks ago, and my yard on that side was left covered in debris, including shingles, paper, pieces of metal, and nails. I had the displeasure of stepping on a nail. Thank god my dogs didn't! No note was left on my door and no attempt was made to contact me regarding a clean-up. What kind of reputable company would do something like this? Disgusting behavior by the roofing crew!

It's a shame as they looked quite good based on the reviews.,I did a bit of research on this company after I was recommended to them by a friend, and when I decided to call them to come give us an estimate, they were not only polite, but very informative and patient with me. San Antonio Roof Experts was very efficient, their price was the best we'd gotten, and all around their customer service was great! I have zero complaints, only compliments in regards to using their services, and would recommend them to anyone in a heartbeat!,A+ service.

Phil came out and gave me and estimate for maintenance. He took pictures and showed me some of the problems. Later I had him come out to do the maintenance. He fixed two potential leak, plus other issues that might have caused problems down the road. They are very professional and did a good job. Again this gentleman was very patient and easy to work with. Plus, he is a big Cowboys fan which is a major plus!,Phil from A-Tex Roofing came out today to give us a quote on a new roof.  We were so happy to hear that our roof looks good and we won't need a new roof for a very long time! It was such a relief!  We so appreciate the honestly and will recommend A-Tex roofing to friends and family.  Thanks again Phil!,Decided to give this company a call for the job I needed done since I always see them around town. Overall it was a great experience!

The job got done in a timely manner and the customer service was exceptional. Would recommend to any one!,First I'd like to disclose, I rarely write reviews.

I've had several home projects over the years and none come close to the level of service provided by Philip Revland and the team over at A-TEX! Helpful and professional!,Philip Revland was the best! He handled everything and made the repair such a fun and exciting job. It was so great to have somebody on your side making sure that everything was covered and taken care of.

Both times they gave excellent service and did a great job on the roof.  I highly recommend working with them.,An outstanding experience.  We have a complex rolled metal roof, with multiple valleys, dormiers, separated sections, breezeway/garage, all interconnected. No insurance involved. We received 6 estimates.  Shield was about the middle of the pack.  One outfit didn't even inspect, just looked at a Google Earth view and shot us an estimate that was ridiculous.  Mason was our contact person, who performed a very extensive inspection; explained his plan in detail, including possible eventualities including potential for additional costs, such as for subroofing material replacement; and then personally supervised the project with at least daily visits.  He was always readily available for questions, and was so patient with my numerous Type A inquiries.  The crew was remarkable. All were pleasant, very polite, considerate of our needs during the process (about a 3-week construction), and performed excellent cleanup.  These guys worked until dark (this was last summer, so they were there until nearly 9 pm) on several days. We had some rain in the middle of the project - a crew hustled out and covered the roof with an impermeable material.  These guys were climbing around on our roof during a thunderstorm! Excellent attention to detail; we ended up with a much better roof than what we had before.  Highly recommended.,Shield did an excellent job! I have a difficult roof to work with because of an add-on and had a persistent leak as a result, and although it required extra materials and  labor, they took care of it expertly  and for no extra charge. The leak is gone. Mason was very helpful and courteous and was clearly concerned with doing the job right and making sure I was happy with the work. The guys worked very cleanly and efficiently - finishing in one day, left no mess and were also very courteous, conscientious, and friendly. You cannot go wrong choosing these guys. Value, quality, and all the intangibles are there.,Shield did excellent work on a roof that was very difficult to work on.  Additionally, it started to rain however, that did not stop Pablo from completing the job.  Thank you Henry quick and efficient response to my roof repair needs.,Filled out an online request for this company to come look at my roof on Friday. It's now Tuesday and I've received no response. I called the company to see if I can get someone on the phone. Speak to a rep who tells me theyre booked until April, but someone could at least come look at it. I say ok, when can you look at it, then instantly changes mind on that, and says they cant even look at it until April. They came recommended from a friend, but apparently doesn't even feel the need to capture my business. Could've emailed that to me Friday, and I'd already have been looking for someone else. Wish I could put half a star... NO HELP AT ALL!!!

To make a long story short:Marco and his helper were sat in the middle of the street in my neighborhood. I was on my way home and decided I would just pass them up instead of waiting on them. Marco punched the gas once I went to go around, and I had to get back behind him. I was a bit close and he decided to brake check me. I hit the brakes and our cars were about a meter apart. I honked my horn at them when Marco threw the truck into reverse and hit me. Marco inspected his truck and then came up to my window asking what my problem was. I had never been in an accident or seen road rage up close and was very intimidated. I started hollering at him to get away from me and that he had just attacked me with his truck. He backed up and started on about how I was crazy, asking if I had "taken my meds" and all of this. He then asked who I thought the cops would believe. I was by myself and he had his helper with him. He went on saying that they wouldn't believe something like that & continued to call me a crazy lady. This happened in September of last year, I was 21, all by myself & really shaken up. I regret not following up with police about what happened.,The sales guys that came to the door were great, then their lead Marco went back on everything i was quoted and promised. Marco changed the cost of the roof 3 times. Ended up having my mothers roof done first because a tree branch fell on it and cracked the roof. Insurance didnt pay out so Jason, one of the other leads said i could make payments.  I would be billed interest free as long as i was actively paying. Then  Marco promised to take $500 off of doing my moms roof which no one honored. The work was contracted out to a different roofing company and was rescheduled 4 times. All the prices quoted went up by a good amount. I had asked that ALL the decking be replaced. The production manager Greg said only 6 sheets needed to be replaced so i spoke to the lead roofer who said all of it needed replacing. It was finally done but no drip edge was put back on. In all this my roof was completely paid out. But now my roof which is 100% paid will not be scheduled until i sign a financial agreement to pay my mothers roof. My roof is being used as leverage but im suppose to trust they will keep their word and do the drip edge after all their lies. DO NOT USE THESE LYING PEOPLE!  You WILL regret it if you do. I was stupid, please dont be stupid too.,Well BCR started out good with Marco from BCR knocking on my door and asking about doing a free estimate on my roof.  He reached out to my insurance company and met up with the adjuster.  During this time he kept in touch with me etc.  There was a stain on my bathroom ceiling caused by the damaged roof and BCR was going to send my insurance a quote, which BCR claimed they had sent it but my insurance never received.  The roof got done, I was not very happy with the nails showing through my deck roof but they could not help that, then the roofers ran out of material so had to come back the next day to finish.  To this day I have not had my bathroom ceiling issue resolved and now that the roof is done, Marco has no need to help me resolve this.  Good talker I guess you could say, when he was getting me to do business with him, but  once the roof was up that was that.  I reached out to BCR and they sent someone out to give me a quote for the ceiling but they just gave me an amount and according to Greg, he doesn't do sales so he can't send a quote to my insurance.  Ridiculous!!,BCR just finished my roof today.  I signed the contract with them in May after the April 12 hail.  At first I felt they were taking too long to get to me to replace my roof. Then I realized that there was a lot of roof damage caused by the hail all over San Antonio and they were very busy. They were very timely in replacing my roof. It took two days only because it rained or they would have finished in one day.  Victoria L. Was very helpful and patient with me.  So was Brenda.  Wayne and Jason were also very  professional and helpful.   Jessey  was very thorough and helpful in making sure that the job went well.  The workers that put the roof were good about picking up all the debris and checking for nails in the yard.  Thanks to all of you.,Best Choice Roofing did a phenomenal job on our roof!. The gentleman that delivered the material were very professional and polite as well as the roofers. My Husband and I are very pleased with our roof. Our neighbors loved the outcome of the roof so they decided to use them as well. I would refer Best Choice Roofing to any of my family and friends.

Our roof was replaced in one day. The crew was highly professional.  They did the work without putting us out at all. The cleanup was done quickly and completely. Spencer and Matt did a super job in managing everything. You cannot go wrong with Your Neighborhoodz.  Larry and Carol Rowe,When my roof started leaking after the hail storms last year, a friend recommended Your Neighborhoodz to me after using them with excellent results.  They did not disappoint! Spencer (owner) is extremely knowledgeable and gave me several options on how to move forward. He took the time to be there with me when the insurance sent out an adjuster to inspect the roof as well. Having him there made my first time dealing with my homeowners insurance a lot less stressful. He was very good at staying in communication with me on timelines and when the day came to put on the new roof, his crew was top notch. They were very considerate of my landscaping and kept the yard neat through the whole process. On top of that the roof came out fantastic! I wouldn't hesitate to make him my first call again when I need another roof, and you shouldn't either!,If I could just write a review and not rate it with any stars I would. We called this company on a Monday to fix a small leak in our roof. Something I estimate wouldn't take longer than 45 minutes. Since I don't have the equipment or courage to scale steep rooftops I had to defer to the professionals. The leak was scheduled to be fixed later that Monday. A job ran over so they would have to come out the next day around 11am. Tuesday 11am came and went. Finally got a phone call from the roofer that was going to do the job saying the job he was at was running long again but they would definitely be here by the late afternoon. The late afternoon came and went. Got another call around 6pm saying that they were still 45 minutes away and wouldn't be able to do the job since it was dark. He rescheduled for Wednesday morning around 7:30 am.Wednesday morning came and went. This time no phone call. I called the main office and left a message and no call back. It is now Thursday morning and I've still heard nothing from the roofer or his office. I'm not saying that you will have the same issues but be prepared to wait. Horrible business practices. Hope the next person has better luck.,My wife and I are writing to inform you of the excellent service that Your Neighborhoodz roofing and construction rendered at our home last week.  In addition to being very personable,  they were very thorough,  very professional , and very competent. They seemed very knowledgable in their profession , and showed genuine concern regarding the damages to our home . When they left, they assured us that if we had any further questions or concerns,  they would be available and for us to feel free to contact them anytime.  It was refreshing to see someone so dedicated to performing the task  at hand, while at the same time, reassuring the homeowners !  We were so pleased with Your Neighborhoodz  job performance and their integrity  that  we wanted to recognize " a job well-done! "  PLEASE convey our thanks.  Sincerely,  John and Krystle,I have used Your Neighborhoodz several times. They are competitive in their pricing and dedicated to making sure the job is done to your satisfaction. They are competent and hard-working. Easy management to work with. A reliable choice with high-quality work. I recommend them without reservation!

He was quick to reply to my inquiry - came out and gave me a very reasonable estimate and did the repair the same day.  I would recommend this roofing company without hesitation.  Thanks Aaran!,ROOF REPAIRS/ROOF REPLACEMENT HIGH RECOMMENDATIONArran Greenleaf is the owner of RepairMyRoof4Less.com….(830) 488-7707….so we started out with completion of repairs to our roof.  While other contractors were telling us we needed to replace our roof here comes Arran Greenleaf.  Arran provided the most intricate details on what was actually needed and it matched the insurance adjustor’s decision that our house was not ready for a roof replacement.  We didn’t tell any of the contractors what the adjustor had told us to see if they had integrity!  We only had one that had integrity – Arran Greenleaf with 25 years of experience.It was then time to replace our roof and don’t let Arran’s company name mislead you as he does roof replacements and I am providing pictures of the beautiful roof he put on our home.  We were able to see pictures with his 3D Roof Models as some of us can’t crawl on roofs.  Arran understands roofing more than any contractor we have done business with and we just remodeled our entire home so can compare his skillsets and passion to other contractors.  He is not out to make a quick buck as he follows up with your family to ensure you are more than satisfied.  Arran does not work a 9 to 5 schedule and will support your schedule needs when you need to meet with him.The actual attention to detail is exemplary!  Arran has a professional flashing work team and the front of our house with the base and counter flashing around the entryway is the best it has ever looked and the quality workmanship stands out!  It is strange to say this; our new roof makes me feel secure as I know Arran cares about my family.  The rain and wind we have had recently, I am inside and have a peace of mind that I have no worries about leaks, finding shingles on the ground after a storm, or having the flashing work leaking into our ceiling and walls.The fireplace chimney base flashing was replaced and we hired a carpenter recommended by Arran as we wanted the rotted wood at the top replaced with plank.  I only have pictures to see it but have a sound mind we won’t have any leaks and our roof is sound for another 20 years or longer.Also, Arran has hydraulic dumpsters on wheels that are used with the work site cleaned up every day before the contractors leave.  We have all seen the flatbed trailers that are used and neighbors see all the debris from start to finish.  I actually caught Arran stopping by one evening outside to make sure quality standards were being met.My family is a firm believer that when you have a customer experience that should be shared with others you take the time to do it!  The Thees Family highly recommends Arran as he is a passionate soul that wants to help you figure out how to repair your roof, meet with adjustors, and when the time comes have a high standard quality roof.  We typically don’t think much about our roofs until we have leaks or see shingles on the ground.We love our new roof and here are the pictures to prove the quality workmanship stands above the rest!Thanks Arran and the RepairMyRoof4Less Team!The Thees Family,Arran was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Gave me a call less than a day after filling out online form.  He was able to find the cause of my leak, when another roofer couldn't, that roofer  blamed it on my HVAC system.  HVAC tech came out and said system was fine.  Got roof repaired less than a week after submitting online form.  There was no leaking from this past weekends storms.  Thank You Arran.,I emailed RepairMyRoof4Less to get a quote to repair a leaking box vent on my roof that was causing my ceiling to leak. Not only was Arran the first person to call me back out of the 3 companies I reached out to, he also was the first to come inspect the home. Within a total of a few days, he had taken pictures of my roof, walked me through my options and performed the work. I ended up replacing all the vents and installing a ridge vent. Arran was very nice to deal with, very knowledgable and fair pricing. Will not hesitate to call him for any future repairs. Thanks Arran!,It took me a while and several quotes to find the roof repair company that I was comfortable going with. As a first time home owner I was very hesitate and cautious picking someone to trust to fix what I have worked so hard for. Then I met Aaron. He wasnt like all of the other people who came out to give me a quote. He explained everything to me in detail and made me feel comfortable with the whole process.
