		        <p>Hello <span class="dynamic_value">[Prospect First Name]</span>,</p>
		        
		        <p>As I mentioned in a voicemail I just left you, I am with My Company (sample) and we help 
					to decrease the sales staff turnover and all cost that come with that.
				</p>
				
		        <p>Reason for the email is that we find that it is very common for 
					sales managers				to have challenges with:
					<ul>
													<li>
								sales resources are not performing well enoughdfh							</li>
													<li>
								it is too time consuming and costly to get new sales resources trained and ramped up							</li>
													<li>
								the team is not generating enough leads							</li>
													<li>
								the level of sales staff turnover is too high and costly							</li>
													<li>
								not able to hit sales targets because of too many under-performing sales people							</li>
											</ul>
				</p>
				
		        <p>I don't know if you are interested in any of those improvements and that is why I am reaching out to you. I will try to give you a call next week. </p>
				<p>If you are interested in talking before then, I can schedule a/an brief 15 to 20 minute meeting next Tuesday or Thursday morning where we can discuss your goals and challenges and share any value and insight that we have to offer.</p>
				<p>Best Regards,</p>
