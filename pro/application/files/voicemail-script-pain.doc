			<p>Hello <span class="red-area">[Prospect First Name]</span>
				
				   this is Rory Browne from Strawberry Studios.
				
				</p>
		        <p>Purpose for my call is that we find that many  
					businesses have challenges with:
					</p>
					<p>
					<span class="red-area">(Share up to three of below pain points)</span>
					</p>
					<p>
					<ul><li>Their website is not performing and producing the type of results that are needed</li><li>It can be difficult to clearly communicate everything offered through a website</li><li>There is room for improvement with the layout and design of the website</li><li>The website conversion rate could be better</li><li>There is a need to increase website traffic</li><li>There is not enough traffic coming to the website through organic SEO (search engine optimization)</li><li>It can be difficult to make the needed website changes that will increase exposure and traffic</li><li>It can be difficult to get their website to generate enough leads</li><li>It can be difficult to find ways to get more revenue out of web traffic</li></ul>				</p>
		        <p><span class="red-area">(Optional disqualify statement) </span>I actually do not know if you are a fit for what we do and that is why I was calling you with a question or two.</p>
				<p>
					I will try you again next week. If you would like to reach me in the meantime, my number is .
				</p>
				<p>Again, this is Rory Browne calling from Strawberry Studios, .</p>
