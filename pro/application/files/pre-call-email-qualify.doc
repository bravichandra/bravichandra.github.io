		        <p><strong>Subject line:</strong> How do you feel about the current design and layout of your website?</p>		        

<p>Hello <span class="dynamic_value">[Prospect First Name]</span>,</p>

<p>The reason I am reaching out is that I am with  
<span>Strawberry Studios</span> and we help 

		businesses to improve their online presence.</p>

<p> I have three quick questions to help determine if it makes sense to talk: </p>
<p>
	
	<ul>
				<li>
			How do you feel about the current design and layout of your website?			</li>
					<li>
			Do you feel like your website is doing a good communicating everything you offer and how you can help?			</li>
					<li>
			Do you feel like your website visitors are able to easily find the information they are looking for or that you want them to see?			</li>
					<li>
			How important is it for you to improve your website conversion rates?			</li>
					<li>
			How much of a priority is it for you to increase the level of website traffic and visitors that you are getting?			</li>
					<li>
			How well are you doing from an SEO perspective (Search Engine Optimization)? Are you getting any organic search traffic?			</li>
					<li>
			How interested are you in exploring small changes you can make to your website that could increase exposure and traffic?			</li>
					<li>
			How important is it for you to find ways to increase the amount of leads that your website is producing?			</li>
					<li>
			How motivated are you to find new ways to get more revenue out of your website traffic?			</li>
			</ul>
</p>
<p>If you answer "Yes" to any of those, we could likely have a very productive conversation. </p>
<p>Let me know if you are interested in putting a few minutes on the calendar.</p>

<br><br>
        <p>Best Regards,</p>
