		        <p>Hello <span class="dynamic_value">[Prospect First Name]</span>,</p>
		        
		        <p>Thank you for connecting, I came across your profile because I work a lot with
					 <span class="red-area">[insert contact's title]</span>
					and I know that they often express concerns with:
				
					<ul>
														<li>
									Their website is not performing and producing the type of results that are needed								</li>
															<li>
									It can be difficult to clearly communicate everything offered through a website								</li>
															<li>
									There is room for improvement with the layout and design of the website								</li>
															<li>
									The website conversion rate could be better								</li>
															<li>
									There is a need to increase website traffic								</li>
															<li>
									There is not enough traffic coming to the website through organic SEO (search engine optimization)								</li>
															<li>
									It can be difficult to make the needed website changes that will increase exposure and traffic								</li>
															<li>
									It can be difficult to get their website to generate enough leads								</li>
															<li>
									It can be difficult to find ways to get more revenue out of web traffic								</li>
												</ul>
				</p>
		        
		        <p>If you are concerned with any of those, we might be able to have a productive conversation as those are the types of challenges that we help to resolve.</p>
				<p>Let me know if you want to put a brief conversation on the calendar. I would be very interested in learning more about what you all are doing.</p>
		        <p>Look forward to possibly talking with you.</p>
		        <p>
