                    <strong>Trial Closing Questions</strong><hr />
    	<p><strong>Description</strong> These are trial closing questions that check in with the prospect to gather details on what they are thinking. These questions should be asked during each stage of the sales cycle.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What do you think of what we have discussed so far?</li>
            <li>How would that feature help your operation?</li>
            <li>Is this something you could see your employees (organization) using?</li>
            <li>Are we heading in the right direction?</li>
            <li>Does this agenda match up with your expectations today?</li>
            <li>Is this what you were expecting to see?</li>
        </ul><br>            
			<strong>Soft Closing Questions</strong><hr />
            <p><strong>Description</strong> These are questions that try to softly close the prospect by letting them lead to the next step. If you have done a good job of qualifying, finding pain, building interest, and building rapport, you can softly close and still see consistent forward movement. Soft closing can have a very positive impact on the level of rapport and the quality of leads that are in your pipeline.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What would you like to do next?</li>
                <li>What direction would you like to go in?</li>
                <li>Do you want to continue talking about this?</li>
                <li>When would you like to talk again?</li>
            </ul>
            <br>           
			<strong>Hard Closing Questions</strong><hr />
            <p><strong>Description</strong> These are hard closing questions that apply a little more directness and pressure for forward movement. These questions can trigger action, but they can also have a negative impact on rapport.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are you ready to move forward to the next step in the process?</li>
                <li>What would you need to be able to make a commitment to move forward?</li>
                <li>If you had everything that you want, are you prepared to move forward?</li>
                <li>If we were able to give you what you are asking for, would you be able to move forward with the purchase?</li>
                <li>When are you going to make your final decision?</li>
                <li>(If delaying the decision for a period of time - X months) OK, but do you mind if I ask if there will be a change or something different at that time that will make that a better time to look at moving forward?</li>
                <li>Is there anything that is preventing you from being able to move forward with this purchase?</li>
            </ul><br>                </td>
            </tr>
