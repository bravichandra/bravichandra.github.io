				<p><strong>Subject line:</strong>  Following up our conversation -  My Company (sample) </p>
		        <p>Hello <span class="dynamic_value edit_area">[Prospect First Name]</span>,</p>
		        <p>t was good to briefly talk with you today. Here is a little more information on how we help 
					sales managers.
				</p>
		        <p>We begin by focusing on driving the following improvements:</p>
					<ul>
														<li>
									get new sales people trained quicker								</li>
															<li>
									teach all of their sales people what best to say and ask when prospecting								</li>
															<li>
									get under-performing on the right track								</li>
															<li>
									improve their ability to train all of their sales resources								</li>
												</ul>
				<p>It is often the case that these changes will lead to the following benefits:</p>
				<ul>
												<li>
								improve the amount of sales that new sales hires generate							</li>
													<li>
								decrease the amount of time and cost needed to train and get new sales people up and running							</li>
													<li>
								improve the lead generation of the entire sales team							</li>
													<li>
								decrease the sales staff turnover and all cost that come with that							</li>
													<li>
								get more sales performance out of their under-performing staff							</li>
													<li>
								decrease the amount of time and cost required to train sales resources 							</li>
										</ul>
				<p>If you are interested in talking before then, I can schedule a/an brief 15 to 20 minute meeting next Tuesday or Thursday morning where we can discuss your goals and challenges and share any value and insight that we have to offer.</p>
		        <p>Best Regards,</p>
