		        <p><strong>Email #1 - Pain Message</strong></p><p><strong>Subject line:</strong> Their website is not performing and producing the type of results that are needed</p>		        
    
    <p>Hello <span class="dynamic_value">[Prospect First Name]</span>,</p>
    
    <p>The reason I am reaching out is that I am with <span>Strawberry Studios</span> and know a lot of  
            businesses often have challenges with:
        </p>
    
    <p>
        <ul>
                        <li>
                Their website is not performing and producing the type of results that are needed                </li>
                            <li>
                It can be difficult to clearly communicate everything offered through a website                </li>
                            <li>
                There is room for improvement with the layout and design of the website                </li>
                            <li>
                The website conversion rate could be better                </li>
                            <li>
                There is a need to increase website traffic                </li>
                            <li>
                There is not enough traffic coming to the website through organic SEO (search engine optimization)                </li>
                            <li>
                It can be difficult to make the needed website changes that will increase exposure and traffic                </li>
                            <li>
                It can be difficult to get their website to generate enough leads                </li>
                            <li>
                It can be difficult to find ways to get more revenue out of web traffic                </li>
                    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>I don't know if you are concerned about any of those and that is why I am reaching out to you. I will try to give you a call next week.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in talking before then, I can schedule a brief 15 to 20 minute meeting next Tuesday or Thursday morning where we can take a look at your website and discuss some of your goals and challenges and we can share some feedback and examples of websites that we have designed that have led to positive results.</p>

					<p>Hello <span class="dynamic_value">[Prospect First Name]</span>,</p>
                    <p>One of the reasons I am reaching out to you is that we worked with previous customer and provided Product X. This helped them to initial improvement, which led to business improvement.</p>					
					<p>I don't know if we can help you in the same way and that is why I am reaching out to you. I will try to give you a call next week.</p>

<hr /><p><strong>Email #4 - Qualify Message</strong></p><p><strong>Schedule Delivery: 1 to 2 weeks</strong></p><p><strong>Subject line:</strong> How do you feel about the current design and layout of your website?</p>		
<p>Hello <span class="dynamic_value">[Prospect First Name]</span>,</p>
<p>I am trying to determine if it makes sense for us to talk at some point. Here are some of the questions that I would ask you to get a better idea on that:	
	<ul>
				<li>
			How do you feel about the current design and layout of your website?			</li>
					<li>
			Do you feel like your website is doing a good communicating everything you offer and how you can help?			</li>
					<li>
			Do you feel like your website visitors are able to easily find the information they are looking for or that you want them to see?			</li>
					<li>
			How important is it for you to improve your website conversion rates?			</li>
					<li>
			How much of a priority is it for you to increase the level of website traffic and visitors that you are getting?			</li>
					<li>
			How well are you doing from an SEO perspective (Search Engine Optimization)? Are you getting any organic search traffic?			</li>
					<li>
			How interested are you in exploring small changes you can make to your website that could increase exposure and traffic?			</li>
					<li>
			How important is it for you to find ways to increase the amount of leads that your website is producing?			</li>
					<li>
			How motivated are you to find new ways to get more revenue out of your website traffic?			</li>
			</ul>
</p>
<p>If you answer "Yes" to any of those, we could likely have a very productive conversation.</p>
<p>Let me know if you are interested in putting a few minutes on the calendar.</p>

<hr /><p><strong>Email #6 - Last Attempt</strong></p><p><strong>Schedule Delivery: 1 to 2 weeks</strong></p><p><strong>Subject line:</strong> Checking In</p>
		        <p>Hello <span class="dynamic_value">[Prospect First Name]</span>,</p>
				
				<p>Hope all is well. I never heard back from you and sometimes "no response" is indeed a response, but I thought I would follow up with you one last time.</p>
		        
				<p>The reason I am trying to connect with you is that we help 
		        
					businesses					with some of the below areas.</p>
		        
				<ul>
												<li>
								Improve the design, traffic, and conversion rates for their website							</li>
													<li>
								Clearly communicate what they have to offer through their website							</li>
													<li>
								Improve the user experience on their website							</li>
													<li>
								Improve website conversion rates							</li>
													<li>
								Increase website traffic							</li>
													<li>
								Improve search engine optimization (SEO)							</li>
													<li>
								Increase their ability to get exposure and traffic from prospects online							</li>
													<li>
								Generate more leads through their website							</li>
													<li>
								Increase the amount of revenue that they are able to generate through their website							</li>
										</ul>
				
		        <p>If I don't hear back from you, I will assume that you are the not right person to speak with or that those are improvements that you are not interested and I will close the file.</p>
		        <p>No problem if that is the direction you prefer. If I should be contacting someone else regarding this, I would greatly appreciate any pointing in the right direction that you can provide.</p>
