		        <p>Thank you for connecting, I came across your profile because I work a lot with
					 <span class="red-area">[insert contact's title]</span>
					and they are often interested in improving some of the following areas:
				
					<ul>
														<li>
									get new sales people trained quicker								</li>
															<li>
									teach all of their sales people what best to say and ask when prospecting								</li>
															<li>
									get under-performing on the right track								</li>
															<li>
									improve their ability to train all of their sales resources								</li>
												</ul>
				</p>
		        
		        <p>If any of those are areas that you are happen to be interested in, we might be able to have a productive conversation as those are the types of things that we help with. </p>
				<p>Let me know if you want to put a brief conversation on the calendar. I would be very interested in learning more about what you all are doing.</p>
		        <p>Look forward to possibly talking with you.</p>
