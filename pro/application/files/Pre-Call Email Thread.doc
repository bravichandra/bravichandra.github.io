    <p>Hello <span class="dynamic_value">[Prospect First Name]</span>,</p>
    
    <p>I want to follow up with you on an email that I sent you last week. The reason that I am reaching out to you is that  
        business can have challenges with:    
        <ul>
                        <li>
                Common Problem1                </li>
                            <li>
                Common Problem3                </li>
                            <li>
                Common Problem4                </li>
                            <li>

                    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>I don't know if you are concerned about any of those and that is why I am reaching out to you.</p>

    <p>Are you available for a brief 15 to 20 minute meeting next Tuesday or Thursday morning where we can discuss your goals and challenges and share any value and insight that we have to offer?</p>

					<p>Hello <span class="dynamic_value">[Prospect First Name]</span>,</p>
                    <p>One of the reasons I am reaching out to you is that we worked with XYZ Corp. (sample) and provided Scripter Pro. This helped them to reducing the amount of time it took to train new sales people, which led to an improvement in sales and decrease in sales staff turnover.</p>					
					<p>I don't know if we can help you in the same way and that is why I am reaching out to you.</p>

<hr /><p><strong>Email #4 - Qualify Message</strong></p><p><strong>Schedule Delivery: 1 to 2 weeks</strong></p><p><strong>Subject line:</strong> Qualify1</p>		
<p>Hello <span class="dynamic_value">[Prospect First Name]</span>,</p>
<p>I am trying to determine if it makes sense for us to talk at some point. Here are some of the questions that I would ask you to get a better idea on that:	
	<ul>
				<li>
			Qualify1			</li>
					<li>
			Qualify3			</li>
					<li>
			Qualify4			</li>
					<li>
			Qualify4			</li>
					<li>
			Qualify			</li>
					<li>
			Qualify5			</li>
					<li>
			Qualify13			</li>
			</ul>
</p>
<p>If you answer "Yes" to any of those, we could likely have a very productive conversation.</p>
<p>Let me know if you are interested in putting a few minutes on the calendar.</p>

<br><br>

<hr /><p><strong>Email #5 - Product Message</strong></p><p><strong>Schedule Delivery: 1 to 2 weeks</strong></p><p><strong>Subject line:</strong>  Scripter Pro (sample) </p>
		        
		        <p>Hello <span class="dynamic_value">[Prospect First Name]</span>,</p>
                <p>If we were to meet and determine that we might be able to help you, it might lead us in a direction of talking about our Scripter Pro (sample).</p>
		        <p>What that provides is builds cold call scripts, email templates, voicemail scripts, objection responses and more. Some ways that this differs from other options out there are:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>There is no solution like this out there</li>
                    <li>Most sales training programs don't help you with what to say</li>
                    <li>Many sales training programs are either fluff or are too complicated</li>
                </ul>
				<p>Are you interested in a brief 15 to 20 minute meeting next Tuesday or Thursday morning where we can discuss your goals and challenges and share any value and insight that we have to offer?</p>

<hr /><p><strong>Email #6 - Last Attempt</strong></p><p><strong>Schedule Delivery: 1 to 2 weeks</strong></p><p><strong>Subject line:</strong> Checking In</p>
		        <p>Hello <span class="dynamic_value">[Prospect First Name]</span>,</p>
				
				<p>Hope all is well. I never heard back from you and sometimes "no response" is indeed a response, but I thought I would follow up with you one last time.</p>
		        
				<p>The reason I am trying to connect with you is that we help 
		        
					business					with some of the below areas.</p>
		        
				<ul>
												<li>
								If the user makes changes and presses save, the new version will be saved somewhere in the database and that is what the user will see when viewing the document.When this action is taken, the entire document becomes “Disconnected” from the Sales Pitch Builder meaning any changes in the Sales Pitch Builder will not be displayed in the new (disconnected) document							</li>
													<li>
								Value3							</li>
													<li>
								Value4							</li>
										</ul>
				
		        <p>If I don't hear back from you, I will assume that you are the not right person to speak with or that those are improvements that you are not interested and I will close the file.</p>
		        <p>No problem if that is the direction you prefer. If I should be contacting someone else regarding this, I would greatly appreciate any pointing in the right direction that you can provide.</p>
				<br><br>
