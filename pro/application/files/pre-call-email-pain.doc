    <p>Hello <span class="dynamic_value">[Prospect First Name]</span>,</p>
    
    <p>The reason I am reaching out is that I am with  
    <span>Strawberry Studios</span> and we find that 
        businesses        can have challenges with:
    
        <ul>
                        <li>
                Their website is not performing and producing the type of results that are needed                </li>
                            <li>
                It can be difficult to clearly communicate everything offered through a website                </li>
                            <li>
                There is room for improvement with the layout and design of the website                </li>
                            <li>
                The website conversion rate could be better                </li>
                            <li>
                There is a need to increase website traffic                </li>
                            <li>
                There is not enough traffic coming to the website through organic SEO (search engine optimization)                </li>
                            <li>
                It can be difficult to make the needed website changes that will increase exposure and traffic                </li>
                            <li>
                It can be difficult to get their website to generate enough leads                </li>
                            <li>
                It can be difficult to find ways to get more revenue out of web traffic                </li>
                    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>We help to improve all of those areas and that is why I am reaching out to you.</p>
    <p>Are you available for a brief 15 to 20 minute meeting next Tuesday or Thursday morning where we can take a look at your website and discuss some of your goals and challenges and we can share some feedback and examples of websites that we have designed that have led to positive results?</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Best Regards,</p>
    <p><span>Rory Browne</span><br /><span>Strawberry Studios</span> <br /><span><a href="mailto:recruitment@strawberry-studios.co.uk">recruitment@strawberry-studios.co.uk</a></span> <br /></p>    <br>
