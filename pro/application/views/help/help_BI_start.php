<p><strong>Explanation</strong><br />
  In order to improve your  ability to build interest with prospects, you will need to clearly know how you  differ from the other options. Try to find a few words that describe how your  products or services are different from your competition. Or you may want to  look at some details around your company and how it operates when identifying  how you differ.</p>
<p>Differentiation can be  around the features and functionality of your products or services. If you have  fairly similar products to your competition, the way you differ may be centered  around your price or level of customer service.</p>
